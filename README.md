# IPA.js

IPA.js is an effort to make Javascript class to display and manipulate IPA consonant tables and vowel trapeziums.

It is a part of making remaking the application the IPA Trainer, but is supposed to also work independently.

## Consonant tables

We start out making the class for the consonant tables.

**TODO (in prioritized order)**

* Function to add new character. We use the IPA numbers from Wikipedia as IDs. See for example [this site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_palato-alveolar_sibilant) 
* Function to remove character.
* Function to display/update table.
* Function to replace character with custom image (needed for IPA Trainer quizzes).
* Add onclick to character.
* Change name of row or column.
