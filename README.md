# IPA.js

IPA.js is an effort to make Javascript class to display and manipulate IPA consonant tables and vowel trapeziums.

It is a part of making remaking the application the IPA Trainer, but is supposed to also work independently.

## Consonant tables

We start out making the class for the consonant tables.

**TODO (in prioritized order)**

* Function to add new character. We use the IPA numbers as IDs. See [this PDF](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/sites/default/files/IPA_Number_chart_(C)2005.pdf) for the numbers.
* Function to remove character.
* Function to display/update table.
* Function to replace character with custom image (needed for IPA Trainer quizzes).
* Add onclick to character.
* Change name of row or column.
